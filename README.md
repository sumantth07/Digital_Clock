Features
Real-Time Updates: The clock updates every second without needing to refresh the page, thanks to JavaScript's setInterval method.

12-Hour Format: Displays time in a standard 12-hour format with AM/PM.

Formatted Display: Automatically adds leading zeros to single-digit minutes and seconds for a consistent look (e.g., 07 instead of 7).

Full Date Display: Shows the current day of the week, month, date, and year.

Stylish UI: Features a modern, dark-themed interface with a glowing, digital-style font for a classic clock aesthetic.

Technologies Used
This project was built using foundational web technologies:

HTML5: For the basic structure of the clock display.

CSS3: For all styling, including the layout, dark theme, custom fonts, and glow effects.

Vanilla JavaScript: For all the logic, including fetching the current time with the Date object and scheduling real-time updates with setInterval.
